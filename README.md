# AIwithCuda

This little deep learning project includes two possible deep learning solutions to the Fashion-MNist database categorization problem.

Both solutions run on Nvidias CUDA.

One of the solution uses a self-built ResNet using residual blocks and the other solution uses a DenseNet. The classification success rate can be seen at the bottom of each file.

I have also included my thought process behind the creation of each deep net and different iteration steps with a result consideration

:)
